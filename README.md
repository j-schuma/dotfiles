These are _my_ dotfiles. They are tailored to bash and osx. Please review before using them.

# Using
I am using the [StreakyCobra approach](https://medium.com/toutsbrasil/how-to-manage-your-dotfiles-with-git-f7aeed8adf8b) for putting my dotfiles under version control.

There are scripts that can help setting up a new machine. You will need to have git and brew installed before running these.
```
# install and configure alacritty
# ./.bootstrap/install-alacritty.sh

# install brew packages. double check if all are required.
# ./.bootstrap/brew.sh

# install brew casks. double check if all are required.
# ./.bootstrap/brewCasks.sh

# configure some osx settings. review script before running it.
# ./.bootstrap/init-osx.sh
```
